My first blog post! I created this website so I can keep track of my hobbies including books, games, coding and other topics as I feel like it.  

I built this website in [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html), using the [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). It's deployed and hosted via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). I chose a minimalist theme called [Renga](https://github.com/nanxstats/hugo-renga), developed by Nan Xiao. 

I'm new to web development and would love to learn from others on how customize my website.
