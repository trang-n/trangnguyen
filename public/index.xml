      <description>My first blog post! I created this website so I can keep track of my hobbies including books and games. I also want to write about different subjects such as statistics, R, Python, and languages as I learn more about them.
This website was built in R using the blogdown package and Hugo, deployed and hosted via Netlify. I chose a minimalist theme called Renga, developed by Nan Xiao.</description>

      <description>My name is Trang Nguyen (she/they). I was born and raised in Viá»‡t Nam and came to the U.S. for college by myself when I was 18.
Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m analyzing population data to inform health and education policies at a global health research institute based in Seattle, WA.
Previously, I worked in the non-profit sector in NYC and Boston, providing legal resources for the low-income population, conducting research to inform immigrant policies, and immigrant youth organizing.</description>
