      <description>My first blog post! I created this website so I can keep track of my hobbies including books and games. I also want to write about different subjects such as statistics, R, Python, and languages as I learn more about them.
This website was built in R using the blogdown package and Hugo, deployed and hosted via Netlify. I chose a minimalist theme called Renga, developed by Nan Xiao.</description>
