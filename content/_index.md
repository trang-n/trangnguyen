**Website is under construction! Please watch your step :)**

Welcome! This is the website of **Trang Nguyen**. I write about things I learn in statistics, the [R language](https://www.r-project.org/about.html), psychology, and social issues.

On this website, you can read my [blog](/blog/), learn more [about](/about/) myself and what I've been [up to](/recent/). Feel free to [contact](/contact/) me to collaborate or just to chat.
