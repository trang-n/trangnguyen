Hello, I'm Trang! Currently, I'm a data analyst working for a global health research institute based in Seattle, WA. Previously, I worked in the non-profit sector in NYC and Boston, providing legal resources for the low-income population, conducting research to inform Census 2020 outreach policies, and immigrant youth organizing. Before that I worked as a writing consultant helping students with academic writing, among other jobs.

I studied Political Science and International Relations for my bachelor degree at Stonehill College. During that time, I enrolled in two exchange programs at School of International Training in Uganda, Rwanda, and Fordham University in New York City, where I gained knowledge in Peace and Conflict Studies and Philosophical Ethics, both of which I enjoyed immensely.
