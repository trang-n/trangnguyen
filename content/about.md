My name is Trang Nguyen. I am currently a Data Analyst at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at University of Washington. This digital garden is an open collections of notes, resources, and exploration I'm currently cultivating. My interests revolve around international development, statistics, data analysis, and social issues.
