My name is Trang Nguyen (she/they). I was born and raised in Viá»‡t Nam and came to the U.S. for college by myself when I was 18. 

Currently, I'm analyzing population data to inform health and education policies at a [global health research institute](http://www.healthdata.org/) based in Seattle, WA.

Previously, I worked in the non-profit sector in NYC and Boston, providing [legal resources](https://vlpnet.org/) for the low-income population, conducting [research](https://www.aafederation.org/our-work/research-2/) to inform immigrant policies, and [immigrant youth organizing](http://www.csioboston.org/). In between, I also worked as a writing consultant helping college students with academic writing at my [alma mater](https://www.stonehill.edu/offices-and-services/cwaa/) and a reference assistant at [MacPhaidin Library](https://www.stonehill.edu/library/).

When I'm not working, I'm a [hobby-explorer](/interests/).
