<p>As I’m changing team at work, I’ve decided to brush up on my Python skill. After digging on the internet for a couple of days, I have chosen to learn from books and projects instead of online courses like I usually do. I have found that books go much deeper than online courses and projects will help me apply what I’ve learned more systematically. Additionally, I no longer have an incentive to obtain completion certifications from online courses and it makes me happy to just learn for the sake of learning.</p>
<p><strong>Books I’m using:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/">Automate the Boring Stuff</a> with Python by Al Sweigart (20 Chapters)</li>
<li><a href="https://inventwithpython.com/beyond/">Beyond the Basic Stuffs</a> with Python by Al Sweigart (17 Chapters)</li>
<li><a href="https://inventwithpython.com/bigbookpython/">The Big Book of Small Python</a> Projects by Al Sweigart (81 projects)</li>
</ol>
<p>The goal is to finish <strong>Book 1</strong> and <strong>Book 2</strong> and complete at least 2-5 projects from <strong>Book 3</strong> in the next 2 weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Schedule:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>3-4 chapters/day and 1-3 projects on weekend</li>
<li>6 days/week.</li>
<li>1 - 3hr/day depending on my workload.</li>
<li><strong>Book 1</strong> and <strong>Book 2</strong> on weekday and <strong>Book 3</strong> on the weekend or not-so-busy workday.</li>
</ul>
<p>I plan to push my study notes/codes on <a href="https://github.com/trang-n">github</a> to keep track of my progress. I will be writing updates at the end of the week to summarize what I’ve learned.</p>
