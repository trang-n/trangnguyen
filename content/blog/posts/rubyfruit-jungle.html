<p>This was my first fiction read in a long time and it was a prefect book to return to. Some of the best quotes from the book are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Is this relationship with Faye Raider of an, uh—intimate nature?” “We fuck, if that’s what you’re after.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This pretty much sums up the protagonist’s personality: outspoken and secure with herself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I began to wonder if girls could marry girls, because I was sure I wanted to marry Leota and look in her green eyes forever. But I would only marry her if I didn’t have to do the housework. I was certain of that. But if Leota really didn’t want to do it either, I guessed I’d do it. I’d do anything for Leota.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“There’s no security with a woman.” “Hell, you married a man and you didn’t have money. And security—you’re secure when you’re dead.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Expecting security from a marriage is a classic patriarchial belief. Equating security with money might be true in the short term, but definitely not for long.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It doesn’t matter to me. We’re still cousins in our own way. Blood’s just something old people talk about to make you feel bad.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brown’s writing is so simple yet powerful, which is not always easy to do, let alone doing consistently. To defy familial bond is a scandalous and dangerous thing to do, especially in the conservative society of 1970s.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Are you married yet?” “Don’t you remember? I told you when we were kids that I was never getting married. I kept my promise.” “Oh, you just haven’t met the right man.” Nervous laugh. “Right. Everybody says that but it’s a load of shit.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nothing an appropriate amount of cursing can’t convey.</p>
