<p>My first blog post! I created this website so I can keep track of my hobbies including books, games, coding and other topics as I feel like it.</p>
<p>I built this website in <a href="https://www.r-project.org/about.html">R</a>, using the <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown">blogdown</a> package and <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. It’s deployed and hosted via <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. I chose a minimalist theme called <a href="https://github.com/nanxstats/hugo-renga">Renga</a>, developed by Nan Xiao.</p>
<p>I’m new to web development and would love to learn from others on how customize my website.</p>
