Who?

Hello, I'm Trang! Currently, I'm a data analyst working for a global health research institute based in Seattle. Previously, I worked in the non-profit sector in NYC and Boston, providing legal resources for low-income population, conducting research to inform Census 2020 outreach policies, and immigrant youth organizing. I studied Political Science and International Relations for my bachelor degree at Stonehill College. During that time, I enrolled in two exchange programs in Uganda, Rwanda, and New York City, where I gained knokwledge in Peace and Conflict Studies and Philosophical Ethics, both of which I enjoyed immensely.
