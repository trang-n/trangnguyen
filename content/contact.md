My motto for communication is that: having access to my contact information doesn't mean you have access to my time. And it goes both ways. 

That said, I am always open to any inquiries and interesting conversations. I also prefer talking face-to-face if possible, be it video-calling or meeting in person. 

If we haven't met in real life, please feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:trangnnnguyen@gmail.com). My non-urgent email response time ranges from 1 to 7 days. 

If we have met (or e-met), you can just text me on any channels in which we're connected. I'd love to hear from you.
